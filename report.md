## A visualisation of measles data - population, measles cases, vaccination rates in the federal states of Germany - and in selected cities.

### Description
<p> Our examination goal in the winter semester 2023/24 is to set up a web application that 
provides a quick and clean insight into a self-selected data set.
This application was developed to show the measles figures for the federal 
  states and selected cities in Germany. 

The project aims to point out the relation between the population and the measles cases in cities, and 
it provides an insight of how many paople are actually vaccinated in each federal state. From this perspective, 
one can actually tell whether a federal state or even a city is secure to live in or not.

However, although measles are a disease for which it is mandatory to report to the government, 
there are always cases which are not recorded and hence not visualized.
