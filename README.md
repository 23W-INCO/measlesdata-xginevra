- ### Who is your key user group? What are your users trying to achieve/understand/ inquire?
  The target group we want to reach are parents of disabled children who are, among other things, immunocompromised. They should be able to see how many of the children in the selected
  federal state are vaccinated and how many of them have actually been sick from measles. It helps deciding whether families should try vaccinating their child or
  not despite several dangers they are exposed to; also it helps finding a fitting federal state with the so called "herd immunity" - so that the children who cannot be vaccinated
   for reasons, find their safe home.
  
  We want to compare the vaccination rates with the actual measle cases in each federal state to see how effective the vaccination is - it may reassure parents or not.
  Also, according to the user group, we want to see where it would be safest to live
  for parents with a disabled/immunocompromised child.

- ### How does the type of visualization chosen help achieve this task effectively and efficiently?
Through visualization on an actual map of germany, every person can directly see
where they must click to see their information of interest. No special reading skills 
are needed to access the map of Germany - assuming they know where they are living. 
As soon as you click on the desired federal state, you'll see the information you want
to see when visiting the website.

- ### How do the other features of your application further help your users achieve this task?
It is visually more appealing to see something you are familiar with (like the map of your country) rather than seeing just 
random diagrams with numbers and names without a picture to them. Clicking on it immediately produces a reaction from the website -
fancy! 
So, information is transmitted more easily for any social class.
