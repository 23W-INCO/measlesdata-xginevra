# A visualisation of Measles Data - 
## Population, measles cases, vaccination rates
### in the Federal States of Germany.

------
- ### What are your users trying to achieve/understand/ inquire?
What we want to see is if there is any causality between the vaccination rates and 
the numbers of measle cases in a federal state - as political opinions in 
every single federal state are different and highly affecting people's lives.

-> TODO: A feature for the future should be the difference between the effectiveness 
of the vaccination in males and females - by comparing the male/female measles cases vs. 
male/female vaccinaton rate. 

-------
- ### Who is your key user group?
  The target group i want to reach are parents of disabled children who are, among other things, immunocompromised. They should be able to see how many of the children in the selected
  federal state are vaccinated and how many of them have actually been sick from measles. It helps deciding whether families should try vaccinating their child or
  not; also it helps finding a fitting federal state with the so called "herd immunity" - so that the children who cannot be vaccinated for reasons, find their safe home.

- ### How does the type of visualization chosen help achieve this task effectively and efficiently?
Through visualization on an actual map of germany, every person can directly see
where they must click to see their information of interest. No special reading skills 
are needed to access the map of Germany - assuming they know where they are living. 
As soon as you click on the desired federal state, you'll see the information you want
to see when visiting the website. 

------
- ### How do the other features of your application further help your users achieve this task?
It is visually more appealing to see something you are familiar with (like the map of your country) rather than seeing just 
random diagrams with numbers and names without a picture to them. Clicking on it immediately produces a reaction from the website -
fancy! 
So, information is transmitted more easily for any social class.

-> TODO: for those who want to see diagrams and naked numbers rather than playing around with a map, I want to embed the map to a page of my website and add an extra page with 
plots and such.
